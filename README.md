## 👋 Hi, I'm M Srija

I'm an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. I hold a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with a minor in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, and I'm currently pursuing another minor in AI from IIT Ropar.

### 💡 What I Do

- 🧠 I build ML models to solve real_world problems.
- 🔍 I explore data with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
- 🧪 I love experimenting with new algorithms and improving model accuracy through clean data and cross-validation.

### 📂 Projects I'm Proud Of

- **[Hate Speech Detection](https://github.com/srijamudimadugula/HSD)**  
  Achieved 90% accuracy using TF-IDF + SVM on text classification.

- **[SMS Spam Recognition](https://github.com/srijamudimadugula/SMS)**  
  Built two models – Naive Bayes and Decision Tree – with up to 98.2% accuracy.

- **[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/srijamudimadugula/loan)**  
  Performed deep EDA and improved credit risk strategy insights by 15%.

### 🛠 Tools & Tech

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NLTK  
- **Concepts**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, EDA  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VS Code

### 🎯 Currently Learning

- Advanced Machine Learning Techniques  
- Deep Learning Architectures (CNNs, LSTMs)  
- Real-world deployment with Streamlit and Flask

### 🌱 My Mission

To build data-driven tools that make a positive impact on society — especially in areas like financial inclusion, education, and public safety.
